## Task 1
Checking the correctness of the bracket sequence.
The input is a string containing various characters,
including the parenthesis characters "({[". It is necessary to implement an algorithm that
determines whether the brackets are nested correctly using the stack. For example,
the sequence "({})" is correct, the sequences "({)}" and "(][)"
are incorrect.


## Task 2
Implement basic operations with a set: adding an element,
deleting an element, checking for the presence of an element in the set, combining
sets, crossing sets, difference sets.


## Task 3
It is necessary to implement an algorithm that finds
the subarray with the largest sum in a circular array.
Example:
Array [ 4, -7, 1, 5, -4, 0, -3, 2, 4, 1]
The subarray with the largest amount - [2, 4, 1, 4]


## Task 4
It is necessary to implement an algorithm that will check whether
the tree is BST1.


## Task 5
Given a chess board of size NxN and the position of the knight. A new position is being set.
It is necessary to calculate and output the shortest path to this position using
a queue.
Example:
4x4 board, position (1, 4), goal (3, 1).
Result: (1, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (3, 1).


## Task 6
It is necessary to implement an algorithm that determines whether the strings
are isomorphic.
Two strings a and b are considered isomorphic if the characters in a can be replaced
by b.
A character is matched only to one other, the order of the characters must
be preserved.
Example:
"fall" and "redd" are isomorphic.
"mad" and "odd" are not isomorphic.
